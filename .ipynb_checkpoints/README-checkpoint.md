# Description
We are determining which neighborhood would be the safest (best) place to accidentally start a fire. 
Our metrics include previous fire incidents in the neighborhood, percent of total neighborhood area that could burn down the easiest, and the most effective fire departments (which would be determined by its placement and the number of buildings it has to cover).
